Now that you have a solid foundation with tests for the server, models, handlers, and services, you can start expanding the functionality of your Omegle clone. Here are a few suggestions for what to work on next:

    Frontend: Create a simple frontend using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to interact with the backend. You could use a JavaScript library like Socket.IO to handle WebSocket connections and events.

    Enhance matching: Improve the chat session matching logic to handle cases like users rejoining the matching queue after leaving a chat session, or adding a waiting room for users until they get matched.

    Add features: Implement additional features such as chat typing indicators, user presence status (online/offline), or user profiles.

    Moderation: Implement a moderation system for user-generated content to ensure a safe and enjoyable experience for all users. This could include automated content filtering, user reporting, and temporary or permanent bans for users who violate the rules.

    Scaling: Consider how to scale your application to handle a larger number of users. This could involve using load balancing, horizontal scaling, or exploring different hosting solutions.

    Monitoring and logging: Implement monitoring and logging tools to keep track of application performance, error rates, and user activity.

Remember to keep following Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles as you continue to expand your project. This will help ensure the quality and maintainability of your codebase.
